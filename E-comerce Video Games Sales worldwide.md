### Project Overview

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing video game sales figures to uncover trends and insights about the gaming industry. 
Our focus will be on identifying top-selling games, comparing regional sales, and evaluating publisher performance over time.

### Overview of the Data

Let's start by examining the available data from two key tables:

### Data Source

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

![VGSalesInfo](VGSalesInfo.csv)

![VGSalesMetrics](VGSalesMetrics.csv)

### Tools:

- Excel - Data cleaning [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis [Download here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-b-dr-1707554&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_665665924750-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+BKWS+-+MIX+%7C+Txt-Data+Analytics-BigQuery-KWID_43700077225652791-aud-1903314850006:kwd-33969409261&utm_term=KW_bigquery-ST_bigquery&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiOy1BhDCARIsADGvQnD6i760VKqILWtABoKV4GXCE-ZKm68bEZE_AvJHqb-paheDk576EAwaAjD-EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&hl=en#from-data-warehouse-to-a-unified-ai-ready-data-platform)

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks: 
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as: 

- What is the top-selling games? 
- What is regional sales comparisons? 
- What publisher performance over time? 
- What country perform best?

#### Fields include
Name - The games name
Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
Year - Year of the game's release
Genre - Genre of the game
Publisher - Publisher of the game
NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

### SQL
I will first show you the raw data from these tables to give you an overview of the dataset.

#### 1. Overview 

``` SQL
SELECT *
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric`;
```

``` SQL
SELECT *
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo`;
```

#### 2. Top 10 Games by Rank
 
 To identify the top 10 games based on their rank, we’ll sort the games by their rank and limit our results to the top 10.

``` SQL
SELECT *
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric`
ORDER BY Rank ASC
LIMIT 10;
```
<img width="1162" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2abbcd5-7867-481a-971b-33d1f7e816c0">

#### 3. Top 20 Games in North America by Sales

Next, let's focus on the top 20 games in North America based on sales. This will help us understand which games have been most popular in this region.

``` SQL
SELECT Rank, Name, Year, NA_Sales
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric`
ORDER BY NA_Sales DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
<img width="1202" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9e95a8-4ced-4a10-9aa4-dbe51e37e027">

#### 4. Regional Sales Comparison
We will now look at the total sales by region to get a sense of how sales are distributed globally.

``` SQL
SELECT SUM(NA_Sales) AS NA, SUM(EU_Sales) AS EU, SUM(JP_Sales) AS JP, SUM(Other_Sales) AS Other, SUM(Global_Sales) AS GL
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric`;
```
<img width="1208" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb09dedc-2991-4141-bc73-8fd79d62f128">

#### 5. Percentage of Global Sales by Region
To understand each region’s contribution to global sales, we calculate the percentage of global sales contributed by each region.

``` SQL
SELECT (SUM(Global_Sales)/SUM(NA_Sales)) AS pNA, (SUM(Global_Sales)/SUM(EU_Sales)) AS pEU, (SUM(Global_Sales)/SUM(JP_Sales)) AS pJP, (SUM(Global_Sales)/SUM(Other_Sales)) AS pOther
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric`;
```

#### 6. Merging Tables for Detailed Insights
We will join VGsalesMetric with VGsalesInfo to enrich our data with additional game details like publisher and genre.

``` SQL
SELECT metric.rank, metric.name, metric.Global_Sales, info.publisher
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info
ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
ORDER BY metric.rank 
LIMIT 5;
```

#### 7. Top 10 Game Genres in North America
Now, let’s analyze which game genres perform the best in North America.

``` SQL
SELECT Info.Genre,
       SUM(metric.NA_Sales) AS Total_North_America_Sales
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info
ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
GROUP BY Info.Genre
ORDER BY Total_North_America_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 8. Top 10 Games in North America vs Japan
We will compare the top 10 games in North America with their sales in Japan.

``` SQL
SELECT Info.Name,
       SUM(metric.NA_Sales) AS Total_North_America_Sales, 
       SUM(metric.JP_Sales) AS Total_Japan_Sales
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info
ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
GROUP BY Info.Name
ORDER BY Total_North_America_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 9. Top 10 Global Sales Publishers
To understand which publishers dominate global sales, we will identify the top 10 publishers based on their total global sales.

``` SQL
SELECT Info.Publisher, SUM(metric.Global_Sales) AS Total_Global_Sales
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info
ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
GROUP BY Info.Publisher
ORDER BY Total_Global_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 10. Top 10 Publishers from 1995 to 2015
Focusing on the period from 1995 to 2015, we’ll analyze the top publishers during these years.

``` SQL
SELECT Info.Publisher, SUM(metric.Global_Sales) AS Total_Global_Sales
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info
ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
WHERE SAFE_CAST(metric.year AS INT64) BETWEEN 1995 AND 2015
  AND metric.year != 'N/A'  
GROUP BY Info.Publisher
ORDER BY Total_Global_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
<img width="1148" alt="13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74c878b3-6b61-4762-844c-a566d33659ae">

#### 11. Percentage of North American Sales in Global Market (1995-2015)
We’ll now calculate the percentage of North American sales compared to global sales for publishers from 1995 to 2015.

``` SQL
SELECT Publisher,
       Total_Global_Sales,
       North_America_Sales,
       (North_America_Sales / Total_Global_Sales * 100 ) AS Percent_America_to_Global
FROM (
    SELECT Info.Publisher AS Publisher,
           SUM(metric.Global_Sales) AS Total_Global_Sales,
           SUM(Metric.NA_Sales) AS North_America_Sales
    FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
    INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info
    ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
    WHERE SAFE_CAST(metric.year AS INT64) BETWEEN 1995 AND 2015
      AND metric.year != 'N/A'  
    GROUP BY Info.Publisher
)
ORDER BY Total_Global_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

``` SQL
SELECT Info.Name,
       SUM(Metric.NA_Sales) AS Total_NA_Sales,
       (SUM(IFNULL(Metric.NA_Sales, 0)) / TotalSales.Total_Sum_NA_Sales ) * 100 AS NA_Sales_Percent_of_Total,
       SUM(Metric.JP_Sales) AS Total_JP_Sales,
       (SUM(IFNULL(Metric.JP_Sales, 0)) / TotalSales.Total_Sum_JP_Sales) * 100 AS JP_Sales_Percent_of_Total
FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric
INNER JOIN `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesInfo` AS Info ON Metric.Rank = Info.rank
CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT 
        SUM(IFNULL(Metric.NA_Sales, 0)) AS Total_Sum_NA_Sales,
        SUM(IFNULL(Metric.JP_Sales, 0)) AS Total_Sum_JP_Sales
    FROM `Portfolio_dataset.VGsalesMetric` AS Metric

## Conclusion
In summary, we’ve explored key insights into video game sales performance, from the top games and publishers to regional sales comparisons. 
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of how different games and publishers perform across various regions, helping us understand market 
trends and consumer preferences better.

## Limitations

I had remove all zero values from columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between number of sales.
