#### Chicago City 311 Service Analysis
For this project, I conducted an analysis on 2.8 million rows of data using a combination of SQL and Excel. The goal was to help a public agency in Chicago improve ticket resolution time by understanding where they should focus their resources on. After exploring the data, I created a priority quadrant based on two selected metrics, plotted the data against the quadrant, cross-validated the findings with data from New York City, and deep dived to find patterns in location fields. In the end, I shared the key insights, suggestions, and remarks in a presentation.

The skills showcased in this project are data querying, data validation, JOINs & UNION clauses, aggregation, datetime conversion, filtering, subqueries, CTEs, conditions, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and presentation.
